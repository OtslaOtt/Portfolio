                                <p>Basement Breakout is an first person 3D "escape the room" type game made for Xamk Game Jam 2022. The game achieves an eerie and scary vibe with simulated ps1 graphics and original soundtrack. You start as a character stuck in a dark basement, needing to solve different puzzles to escape. </p>

                                <p>I was in charge of designing and coding the puzzles for this game. The most difficult part was trying to manage clean code with a thight schedule. For me it was a great learning experience of keeping flow, design and structure between puzzles not only on a design level, but in code as well. </p>
