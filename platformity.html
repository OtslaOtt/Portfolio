                                <p>Platformity is a 2D platformer, in witch you play as a small box trying to pass through levels. The player can create and destroy certain blocks to avoid obstacles. Currently there are a total of 35 levels, segmented into groups of five, where a new game mechanic is introduced and difficulty increases throughout the five levels. </p>

                                <p>My contributions to the game were mainly on the level design side. I was responsible for coming up with unique level ideas while keeping the level flow and difficulty on a enjoyable level. This was a great learning experience.</p>
